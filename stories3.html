        Before the all-weather Karakoram Highway was built, Babusar Top, which forms the summit of Kaghan Valley, was a part of the traditional summer route providing access to the Gilgit-Baltistan region. From 1947 until 1978, when the KKH was formally opened for conventional transportation, it was the main route. To connect Gilgit-Baltistan with British India, the British constructed it in 1890</p>
      <h2>Why is it Called Babusar Top?:</h2>
      <p> Due to the Mughal emperor Babur frequently passing through this region in the early 16th century, Babusar Top was previously known as Babur Top. But nowadays, people refer to it as Babusar Top..</p>

        From the city of Mansehra, one has to take the Naran-Babusar top road, which leads straight to the valley of Naran Kaghan via Balakot. After reaching the Naran valley, tourists can visit Saif ul Malook by a thrilling hike or a 30-minute adventurous and curvy jeep ride</p>
