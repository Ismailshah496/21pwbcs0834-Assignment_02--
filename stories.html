      <p>With its majestic self, this lake carries a lot of interesting mystical tales of fairies and princes because of its undefined beauty. Saif ul Malook was formed in the greater Pleistocene Period, almost 300,000 years back. Because of rising temperatures and receding glaciers, the melted water was gathered in a large depression where the glacier once stood.</p>
      <h2>Accessibility and Climate:</h2>
      <p>Jheel Saiful Malook is mostly accessible during summer, which is from May to mid-September. The weather in these months remains pleasant. However, the access during winter is limited as heavy snowfall and landslides threaten to segregate the lake from other regions.</p>

The water temperature of the lake remains below 10 degrees as it mostly receives glacial waters. Large brown trout are found in the icy waters of the Jheel.</p>
